1. Definition

- Specification – what this is all about e.g. Card Deck
The "Library" website that we have created allows a user to list out all the available library books in a particular category.

- User’s manual with screen shots
Hello Customer!
Welcome to Library website.
Please choose a category of books for which you wish to see the available books.

Available categories are: fiction and adventure.
Please enter one of the following words:
fiction 
adventure



- Test cases: what will be tested?
None


2. Design

- Data structures, files etc.
There are four classes apart from a testLibrary file:
Reader, Author, Person, Book 

Every Book Object has two type of data: 
(i)    five fields, namely, title, genre, pages, readerID and authorID, that are entered directly with a new book entry
(ii)   arrays authorDetails and readerDetails. 
The testLibrary files uses Book Class's methods getReaderID () and getAuthorID () to fill in the authorDetails and readerDetails fields of every Book object that is created.
The authorDetails and readerDetails attributes of Book are filled from data stored in objects of type Reader and Author. 
The parent class for the Reader and Author classes is the Person class.




- UML diagrams (min 4 classes, one container class, inheritance included on some level!)


3. Implementation

- Well commented code (phpDoc /** */)

- Results of test cases


4. Delivery

- Installation and requirements

- Link to your site

5. Conclusion

- Targets fulfilled?

a)  In programming
A very rudimentary programming application has been created. Application performs the basic function of presenting the results according to the users' selection.
Though we do have a working application, some basic features, such as the provision for a user to add books through an interactive screen, is missing.

b)  In working


c)  In learning
We learnt how to loop through arrays and obtain different kinds of search results

6. Ideas for further developments:
1.  Provision for an admin user to add books through an interactive screen,
2.  Provision for a user to select genre from a combo box.
3.
